		What is a URL?

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.
How is a URL structured?

The URL contains the name of the protocol needed to access a resource, as well as a resource name. The first part of a URL identifies what protocol to use as the primary access medium. The second part identifies the IP address or domain name -- and possibly subdomain -- where the resource is located.

URL protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for web resources, mail to for email addresses, FTP for files on a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, and telnet for a session to access remote computers. Most URL protocols are followed by a colon and two forward slashes; "mail to" is followed only by a colon.

Optionally, after the domain, a URL can also specify:

    a path to a specific page or file within a domain;
    a network port to use to make the connection;
    a specific reference point within a file, such as a named anchor in an HTML file; and
    a query or search parameters used -- commonly found in URLs for search results.

Importance of a URL design

URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. Because URLs often contain non-ASCII characters, the URL must be converted into a valid ASCII format. URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits. URLs cannot contain spaces.
URL examples

When designing URLs, there are different theories about how to make the syntax most usable for readers and archivists. For example, in the URL's path, dates, authors, and topics can be included in a section referred to as the "slug." Consider, for example, the URL for this definition:

https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL
Basic structure of a URL

Look past the protocol (identified as HTTPS) and the permalink (www.techtarget.com) and we see the file path includes two paths (searchnetworking and definition) and the title of the definition (URL).

Additionally, some URL designers choose to put the date of the post, typically, as (YYYY/MM/DD).
Parts of a URL

Using the URL https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/search/query?q=URL as an example, components of a URL can include:

    The protocol or scheme. Used to access a resource on the internet. Protocols include http, https, ftps, mailto and file. The resource is reached through the domain name system (DNS) name. In this example, the protocol is https.
    Host name or domain name. The unique reference the represents a webpage. For this example, whatis.techtarget.com.
    Port name. Usually not visible in URLs, but necessary. Always following a colon, port 80 is the default port for web servers, but there are other options. For example, :port80.
    Path. A path refers to a file or location on the web server. For this example, search/query.
    Query. Found in the URL of dynamic pages. The query consists of a question mark, followed by parameters. For this example, ?.
    Parameters. Pieces of information in a query string of a URL. Multiple parameters can be separated by ampersands (&). For this example, q=URL.
    Fragment. This is an internal page reference, which refers to a section within the webpage. It appears at the end of a URL and begins with a hashtag (#). Although not in the example above, an example could be #history in the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#History.

Other examples of parts of a URL can include:

    The URL mailto:president@whitehouse.gov initiates a new email addressed to the mailbox president in the domain whitehouse.gov.
    The URL ftp://www.companyname.com/whitepapers/widgets.ps specifies the use of the FTP protocol to download a file.

HTTP vs. HTTPs

Both HTTP and HTTPS are used to retrieve data from a web server to view content in a browser. The difference between them is that HTTPS uses a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to encrypt the connection between the end user and the server.

HTTPS is vital to protecting sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers and identity data, from unauthorized access.

HTTPS uses TCP/IP port number 443 by default, whereas HTTP uses port 80.
URL vs. URI

A URL is the most common type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URIs are strings of characters used to identify a resource over a network. URLs are essential to navigating the internet.
URL shorteners

URL shortening is a technique in which an URL may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. A shortener achieves this using a redirect on a domain name that is short.

There are many URL shortener services available. While many are free, those that offer capabilities such as Web analytics, charge a fee. Companies that offer URL shorteners include Rebrandly, Bitly, Ow.ly, clicky.me and Budurl.com.

Some Web site hosts, such as GoDaddy.com, offer URL shorteners. Other service providers, including search engines, have begun turning away from URL shorteners because they are often subject to abuse by spammers, who hide malware inside shortened URLs.
URL history

The retention of data related to Web usage has become a huge privacy concern. There has been increased public demand for search engine and application service providers to be transparent in what information they collect, retain and sell.

For example, in March 2019, Google updated its Chrome privacy policy. It notes that in its basic browser mode, the search engine stores information locally on your system. This information includes browsing history, including URLs of pages visited, plus a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages.

However, Google also collects and retains data for various lengths of time. Some data can be deleted whenever a person wants, some data is deleted automatically, and some data Google retains for longer periods of time when necessary.
			<li><a href="#Top">Top</a></li>
		<h2 id="SourceAnchors">SourceAnchors</h2>
		The anchor element is used to create hyperlinks between a source anchor and a destination anchor. The source is the text, image, or button that links to another resource and the destination is the resource that the source anchor links to.
		<li><a href="#Top">Top</a></li>
		<h2 id="DestinationAnchors">DestinationAnchors</h2>
		Links and Anchors

A link is the traversable connection between two nodes. An anchor is the visible region which must be selected to activate the link. These may vary in size from one word to the entire contents of the node. For example, in this current node, the word "nodes" in the first sentence is an anchor. It is the visible part of a link between the nodes "Links and Anchors" and "Node." In theory, anchors may overlap; in practice, most systems insist on their being distinct, in order to make the underlying mechanics simpler.

The granularity of link destinations is an important qualifier. Some systems support only basic links, eg. those which connect two nodes without specific anchors. Source anchors are available in almost all hypertext systems. Destination anchors allow a particular region of a node to be addressed; this becomes the focus when the link is traversed. For multi-screen nodes, this is a helpful feature. However, destination anchors are supported in only some hypertext systems. More often, the entire destination node is referenced, and the reader is placed at the beginning of the text. This may result in disorientation, particularily if more than a screenful of text must be traversed before the passage relevant to the link is discovered.

Many software packages refer to anchors as "buttons," though the latter is more properly considered a feature of the user interface and not the underlying functionality. Anchor appearance varies in different systems.

Once an anchor is selected, the link is activated. If more than one link is available for the anchor, either a choice is presented to the reader, or the system selects from the possibilities according to pre-defined criteria. The actual navigation of the link proceeds according to the link class.

Links may have other characteristics such as name, author, creation date, and access rights.

HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and organize the content on a web page. It uses various tags to define the different elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and links.
HTML Hierarchy

HTML elements are hierarchical, which means that they can be nested inside each other to create a tree-like structure of the content on the web page.

This hierarchical structure is called the DOM (Document Object Model), and it is used by the web browser to render the web page. For example,

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My web page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is my first web page.</p>
        <p>It contains a 
             <strong>main heading</strong> and <em> paragraph </em>.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

Browser Output
A simple HTML example to demonstrate hierarchy

In this example, the html element is the root element of the hierarchy and contains two child elements: head and body. The head element, in turn, contains a child element called the title, and the body element contains child elements: h1 and p.

Let's see the meaning of the various elements used in the above example.

    <html>: the root element of the DOM, and it contains all of the other elements in the code
    <head>: contains metadata about the web page, such as the title and any linked CSS or JavaScript files
    <title>: contains the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the web browser's title bar or tab
    <body>: contains the main content of the web page, which will be displayed in the web browser's window
    <p>: contains the paragraphs of text on the web page
    <strong>, <em>: child elements of the <p> elements, they are used to mark text as important and emphasized respectively

Note: Only the elements inside the <body> tag renders in the web browser.
What are HTML elements?

HTML elements consist of several parts, including the opening and closing tags, the content, and the attributes. Here is an explanation of each of these parts:
Basis html elements

Here,

    The opening tag: This consists of the element name, wrapped in angle brackets. It indicates the start of the element and the point at which the element's effects begin.
    The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. It indicates the end of the element and the point at which the element's effects stop.
    The content: This is the content of the element, which can be text, other elements, or a combination of both.
    The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together make up the element.

What are HTML Attributes?

HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. They are specified in the opening tag of the element and take the form of name-value pairs. Let's see an example:

<a href="http://example.com"> Example </a>
Note: Only the elements inside the <body> tag renders in the web browser.
